# Trivia API

Udacity is committed to fostering a sense of community among its workers and students. A group of team members came up with the concept of holding trivia on a regular basis and established a website to administer the trivia app and play the game, but their API knowledge is limited and has to be expanded.
I'm helping them finish the trivia app as part of the criterion for earning a nanodegree certificate in fullstack web development, so they can start having trivia and seeing who's the most knowledgable of the group. The application must include the following functions:

* Display questions - Questions should show the question, category, and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
* Delete questions - Users can delete questions from the frontend by clicking on the delete icon. This removes the question with a specific question ID from the database.
* Add questions - Users can add questions and answers. Both question and answer fields are required.
* Search - Users can search for questions based on a text query string and the result(s) displayed provided that the query string matches a substring of questions in the database.
* Play the quiz game - Users can play the quiz game depending on the choice of selection. Users can select 'ALL' to display a list of all questions at random or select a specific category to display a list of questions at random within the selected category.

## Setting up the Backend

### Install Dependencies

* Python 3.7 or Python 3.7+ - You can read the official documentation of the latest version [here](https://docs.python.org/3/)
* Virtual Environment - (NB: This operation should be done in your backend folder). When using Python for projects, we recommend working in a virtual environment. This keeps your project dependencies distinct and structured. The python documentation include instructions for creating a virtual environment for your platform. You can visit this [resource](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-flask) for additional information on how to setup virtual environment for various OS. The core dependencies are Flask, Flask-CORS and SQLAlchemy.
* PIP Dependencies - Once your virtual environment is up and running, navigate to the /backend directory and run the appropriate dependencies.
<pre>
    # installs all the dependencies needed for this project
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # alternatively, for key dependencies run
    pip install Flask
    pip install Flask-CORS
    pip install SQLAlchemy
</pre>

### Setting up the Database

This project uses the Postgres database. Install 
* Ensure you have PostgreSQL server installed on your local machine. You can downlod it [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
* Login to your Postgres account via your terminal or user friendly pgAdmin
* After logging in to your terminal run 
<pre> 
    # to create a new database in windows OS
    CREATE DATABASE trivia
    # to create a new database in MAC or Linux OS
    createdb trivia
    # using pgAdmin
    expand servers at the left pane of pgAdmin software, right click on database and select create to create a new postgres database
</pre>
* To connect to your newly created database in your terminal run: <pre> \c trivia </pre>
* To populate the database you just created with the trivia.psql file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run: <pre>  psql trivia < trivia.psql </pre>
* Alrernatively you can populate your newly created database with the trivia postgres script (trivia.psql) using pgAdmin. Expand your database name, right clik on 'Schema' and select 'PSQL Tools'. In 'PSQL Tools' run: <pre> [database_name]-#  \i   /path/to/trivia.psql </pre>

### Running the Server
Navigate to your backend folder in your terminal and run the command below
<pre>
    set FLASK_APP=flaskr
    set FLASK_ENV=development
    flask run 
</pre>

## Frontend

The frontend is built using React JS. Developers should ensure they use the latest React JS library. 
To intall React JS, run <pre>   npm install or npm i </pre>

### Starting the Server
To start the server run <pre>   npm start </pre>


## API Documentation

### Getting Started

Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, http://127.0.0.1:5000/, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration.
Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys.
